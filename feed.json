When I was looking to replace my computer's speakers I throw the Echo Studio into the possibilities.</p>\n<h3>Concerns</h3>\n<p>The specifications for the Studio say that it can be connected to a computer through both bluetooth and a wired connection, but I have found with devices in the past that just because something is capable, it isn't always easy or the results are not what one would expect.</p>\n<h3>Use</h3>\n<p>The Amazon Alexa app seems to get worse with time, and you have to use it to set up the speakers. That is the worst part, but I'm used to that by now.</p>\n<p>The speakers themselves sound fantastic. If you are not using it to replace a TV sound system, I don't think the subwoofer is necessary. I use them for my TV sound with my <a href=\"https://blackstripespub1.github.io/reviews.blackstripespub.com/fire-tv-stick-4k-max.html\">Fire TV</a> and love this pairing.</p>\n<p>I have connected the Echo Studio to my computer, but mostly just stream music to it from Spotify and use some old computer speakers for the rare time I need to hear computer audio since I mostly rely on <a href=\"https://blackstripespub1.github.io/reviews.blackstripespub.com/sony-mdr7506-professional.html\">headphones</a>. Fortunately, computers can send audio in multiple directions these days.</p>\n<p>I was also given a free trial of Amazon Music. What a disappointment. The sound quality is excellent but the day to day use of Amazon Music is too painful. I barely used it at all since you cannot control your audio stream from a desktop computer like you can for Spotify. Until Amazon sorts out that basic feature they will struggle to gain members. Why can every other streaming service work with an Echo and Amazon can't?</p>\n<h3>Rating</h3>\n<p>Outstanding. I really love the Echo Studio and Sub and use them for hours every day. 10/10</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3UCtncK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy the Echo Studio and Echo Sub on Amazon</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GM2mxA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy Echo Studio on Amazon</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3GGZVwk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy Echo Sub on Amazon</a></p>\n<p> </p>",

This is why I opted for the 80V mower.</p>\n<h3>Set up</h3>\n<p>I put the batteries on the charger immediately since they do not come fully charged and should be fully charged before first use (as with most rechargeable battery operated things these days). This did not take more than several minutes for each battery.</p>\n<p>There is not much to do to set up the mower other than removing it from the box. I only had to install the top portion of the handle which required the included nuts and bolts and a philips head screwdriver. It was not difficult and the instructions were clear.</p>\n<h3>Use</h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Just press the start button and it is running. No gas and no oil and the yearly maintenance of such things.</span></p>\n<p>I mowed our entire yard very quickly using the self-propelled mode almost the entire time. I found the mower to be very powerful and only used the larger 4.0 Ah battery leaving the 2.0 Ah hour battery fully charged. Even when the grass is thicker expect no problems mowing the yard with a single set of charged batteries.</p>\n<p>At one point the mower did stop and needed a few seconds before it would restart. I am not sure why this happens (although I read elsewhere that this can occur). It only happened one time over the course of about an hour.</p>\n<h3>Rating</h3>\n<p>The Greenworks 80V 21\" Self-Propelled Mower exceeded my expectations. 10/10</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/41LN30f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy it on Amazon</a></p>",
